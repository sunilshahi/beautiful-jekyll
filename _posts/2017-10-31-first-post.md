Do you find yourself copying and pasting a lot of codes? If yes, then you might have found yourself being agitated while you copied and pasted multiple separate line(s) of code and between two or more files. Well here is a trick for that.

Visual Studio and Sql Server Management Studio has a feature called __Clipboard Ring__. Using this feature you can copy/cut number of items to your clipboard and cycle through them while pasting using <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>. The clipboard ring saves last 20 items you copied to your clipboard.

Now only if this was available natively in windows.
